# STM32F746-RCC-Max-Freq-SysTick-Basic-Timer-Demo
Basic demo of setting up max overdrive frequency for MCU, using SysTick to make delay, using basic timer with interrupts

Clock: 216MHz; 25MHz external oscillator with PLL.<br>
LED on PI1.<br><br>


This project is a proof of concept (that I can).

Might be useful for someone who wants to figure out how the stuff works.
I commented almost every line to make it simple to understand.
